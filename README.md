# ADHD_DETECTION_USING_CNN_DL_MODEL
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a  neurodevelopmental disorder that has inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Accurate and early diagnosis is essential ;however, traditional diagnostic methods rely on subjective assessments. here we propose a machine-learning-based approach for ADHD detection using EEG signals.
